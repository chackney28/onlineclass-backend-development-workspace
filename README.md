This is the place where I will be storing all the various documents in relation to the course I am currently taking related to backend development. In here will contain the various project files, the notes, and even mistakes I made along the way. By the end of the course, this should look like a development log of all the things I learned over the course and how much I grew over time.

The learning objectives for the course are:

-Create web applications with relational databases using modern backend technologies.

-Create, execute, and debug scripts in environments for various backend tasks.

-Construct RESTful APIs with the ability to perform CRUD operations.

-Create middleware for different functionalities, such as request processing, session management, and authentication.

-Design applications with features that control access based on user roles or permissions, utilizing authorization techniques.

-Use version control systems like Git for code management.

-Design relational databases to efficiently store, query, and manipulate data for backend applications.

I plan to use this repository frequently in place of storing everything related to this course on my personal machine. It will be updated semi frequently.
